min sum path
==========================================================================================================================================
Explanation  
In minimum path sum problem, our job is to find that path in a matrix that minimizes the sum consisting of all the integers which come in the path, so we need to declare a function where the function is defined as to return the smallest value between the two values which are passed on to that function.

So now, we start a nested for loop, make the outer loop run-up to the value (row -1) is reached, and the inner loop up to column -1 is reached.
